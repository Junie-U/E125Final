                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Hackers breached Target’s payment systems by compromising a third-party HVAC vendor, stealing credit card information of 40 million customers. The attack exploited lax vendor security controls to access Target’s network.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Should companies be responsible for ensuring third-party vendors meet cybersecurity standards? How can businesses ethically balance cost savings from outsourcing with potential security risks?</p>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, leaked classified documents revealing extensive global surveillance programs by the U.S. government. These programs collected data on citizens and foreign governments without consent, sparking international outrage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Snowden’s actions posed a moral question: Is whistleblowing ethical when it exposes government overreach but violates national security laws? The case also raised concerns about the balance between privacy and security in a digital age.</p>

The breach exposed millions of email addresses, payment details, and private information, leading to public embarrassment, blackmail, and even suicides.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Is it ethical to expose personal data, even when the targeted organization promotes morally questionable services? Should hackers take moral judgment into their own hands, or is privacy inviolable regardless of context?</p>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Uber concealed a major data breach that exposed the personal information of 57 million users and drivers. Instead of disclosing the breach, Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data and remain silent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Should companies prioritize transparency in data breaches, even at the expense of reputation and trust? Is it ever ethical to pay off cybercriminals to prevent public harm or fallout?</p>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> After a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, the FBI requested Apple’s assistance in unlocking an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the attackers. Apple refused, arguing that creating a backdoor to bypass encryption would weaken security for all users and could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> The conflict highlighted the tension between national security and individual privacy. Should tech companies compromise user security to aid law enforcement? What are the long-term risks of creating such backdoors, even for legitimate purposes?</p>

                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> WannaCry ransomware spread rapidly across networks, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft’s software. The attack severely disrupted the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), delaying surgeries, shutting down medical equipment, and putting patient lives at risk. The attackers demanded payment in Bitcoin to decrypt affected systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> This case raised questions about paying ransoms to protect critical infrastructure.

This incident showcased the potential of deepfake technology to deceive and commit fraud.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> The misuse of deepfake technology raises concerns about accountability and regulation.

The breach went undetected for months, exposing sensitive data to foreign adversaries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Should software providers be held legally responsible for supply chain vulnerabilities? How can organizations balance the need for trust in third-party vendors with due diligence in cybersecurity?</p>
